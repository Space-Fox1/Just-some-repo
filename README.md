Dont mind this, its just for my file sharing shortcut. Only cause my school banned airdrop and people want to share images.

Roadmap:
1. Better way to show the QR codes
2. Faster update checking(May not be possible?)
3. Widespread adopting by people in my school
4. Smaller QR codes(Link shorteners? Compression algorithms?)

**And to any school staff, please put a issue into report if you want this taken down. I can push a update to remove everything.**
