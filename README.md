# Did you ever want to share an image with your friends, but couldn't? Well now you can. Share Everything uses Icloud links to share any image, video, text, files, or other shortcuts wiht just a QR code! 

Roadmap: 
1. Better way to show the QR codes
2. Faster update checking(May not be possible?)
3. Widespread adopting by people in my school
4. Smaller QR codes(Link shorteners? Compression algorithms?)
